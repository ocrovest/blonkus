# Blonkus
This is Blonkus, a small project I made with **Ollama** and **Flask**

after watching this video called [*i prompt injected apple intelligence - Evan Zhou*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4Yba_JVFU8), and decided to make my own AI Tool.

It uses qwen2.5:1.5B by default but you should change it

## Prerequisites 
ollama 0.3.3
flask

## Start the site
Just run `main.py`!

You can choose models of your own on the site!
